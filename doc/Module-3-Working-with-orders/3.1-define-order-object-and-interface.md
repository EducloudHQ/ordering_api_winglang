Within your project folder, create a new file and call it `orders.w`. 

The `orders.w` file will contain all the code and resources needed to interact with orders.

Let's import the required libraries from wing.

```wing
bring cloud;
bring ex;
bring util;
bring http;
```

### Define the product object.


```wing
struct Order {
  id: str;
  productId: str;
  qty: num;
  status: str;
}
```

Let's break down the code.

The above code snippet define an `order` object with its properties and their corresponding datatypes.


### Defining the IProductStorage Interface

```wing
interface IOrderStorage extends std.IResource {
  inflight add(id: str, j: Json): void;
  inflight get(id: str): Order?;
  inflight list(): Array<Json>?;
  inflight updateOrderStatus(id: str, status: str): void;
}
```

The above code snipet defines an `interface` IOrderStorage that extends `std.IResource` class.

The interface contains 05 different methods.

For each method within defined in the interface, it specifies the method name, arguments and types, and the return type.

In the next lesson, we'll see the implementation of the methods.
