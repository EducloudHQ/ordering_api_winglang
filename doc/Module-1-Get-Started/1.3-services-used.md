This workshop makes use of a couple of winglang cloud services which include:

- [**API**](https://www.winglang.io/docs/standard-library/cloud/api): The cloud.Api resource represents a collection of HTTP endpoints that can be invoked by clients over the internet. APIs often serve as the front door for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services.

    The Api resource models an endpoint as a collection of routes, each mapped to an event handler function. A route is a combination of a path, like "/users/:userid" and a set of HTTP methods, like GET, POST, or DELETE. When a client invokes a route, the corresponding event handler function executes.

- [**QUEUE**](https://www.winglang.io/docs/standard-library/cloud/queue): The cloud.Queue resource represents a data structure for holding a list of messages. Queues are typically used to decouple producers of data and the consumers of said data in distributed systems. Queues by default are not FIFO (first in, first out) - so the order of messages is not guaranteed.

-  [**COUNTER**](https://www.winglang.io/docs/standard-library/cloud/counter): The cloud.Counter resource represents a stateful container for one or more numbers in the cloud.

- [**TABLE**](https://www.winglang.io/docs/standard-library/ex/table): A NoSQL database table that can be used to store and query data.

- [**HTTP**](https://www.winglang.io/docs/category/http): The Http class is used for calling different HTTP methods and requesting and sending information online, as well as testing public accessible resources.
