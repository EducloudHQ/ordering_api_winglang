Within your project folder, create a new file and call it `products.w`. 

The `products.w` file will contain all the code and resources needed to interact with products.

Let's import the required libraries from wing.

```wing
bring cloud;
bring ex;
bring util;
bring http;
```

### Define the product object.


```wing
 struct Product {
    id: str;
    name: str;
    qty: num;
    price: num;
    imageUrl: str;
  }
```

Let's break down the code.

The above code snippet define the product object with its properties and their corresponding datatypes.



### Defining the IProductStorage Interface

```wing
pub interface IProductStorage extends std.IResource {
    inflight add(product: Json): str;
    inflight remove(id: str): void;
    inflight get(id: str): Product?;
    inflight updateProduct(id: str, qty: num): void;
    inflight list(): Array<Json>;
  }
```

The above code snipet defines an `interface` IProductStorage that extends `std.IResource` class.

The interface contains 05 different methods.

For each method within defined in the interface, it specifies the method name, arguments and types, and the return type
